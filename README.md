# 🚆 Railway Track Optimization System

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Railway Track Optimization System** is a web-based application that optimizes railway network efficiency. It helps in:  
- Finding the **shortest travel routes** between stations 🛤️  
- Reducing the number of active tracks 🚆  
- Maximizing train flow for better scheduling ⏳  

The system uses **graph algorithms** such as:  
✅ **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** (Shortest Path)  
✅ **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** (Optimized Track Usage)  
✅ **Ford-Fulkerson’s Max Flow Algorithm** (Train Flow Optimization)
